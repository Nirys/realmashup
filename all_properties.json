The dining leads into the kitchen and side access to a huge under-covered outdoor deck complete with lighting and an outdoor fan. <br\/><br\/>The eastern wing, with its own secure front access offers five bedrooms, two bathrooms, a lounge, kitchenette, laundry and direct access to the rear pool area.

Low maintenance front, side and rear garden beds.

on approximately 974 square metres in the prominent Craigburn Estate, this quality home has so much to offer the modern family.<br\/><br\/>With a charming street appeal and easy access via the wide

level, from the living and dining areas on the ground level. <br\/><br\/>Timber floors lead you from the entrance through the formal lounge and into the separate dining area; where timber turns to tiles you are presented with a spacious second living area that flows into the newly appointed kitchen. <br\/> <br\/>Boasting loads of storage and bench space, the stylish kitchen is the perfect starting point to any gathering with friends, before everyone instinctively spills out on to the deck. <br\/><br\/>Enjoy treetop views from the expansive deck which spans the entire width of the home.

immaculately presented, family home in picturesque Coromandel Valley enjoys a tranquil natural setting with a wonderful valley outlook and is bordered by mature trees including River Red gum and grey box.<br\/><br\/>The home is light filled, airy & spacious, lovingly upgraded to embrace the charm and character of the foothills. Quality fixtures, finishes and textures promote the neutral d\u00e9cor with a warm, yet soft colour palate. Clean lines and soft edges are on show in the main bathroom with rain shower over a full-sized tub. These features are continued through the fully upgraded ensuite and continue to the upgraded laundry and separate toilet.<br\/><br\/>With 3 bedrooms in the main home, 2 with built in robes and a walk-in robe to the master, this family home has the room required for growing families. Year-round comfort has been ensured by the provision of ducted reverse cycle air conditioning throughout with supplemental ceiling fans to master and second bedrooms. Bottled gas takes care of the hot water with mains connections available in the street.<br\/>An upgraded U-shape kitchen, open plan to family & dining, provides plenty of storage and bench space. With modern conveniences such as electric cooking, dishwasher, double sink and breakfast bar, this kitchen can deal with the early morning breakfast rush through to dinner party hosting or large family gatherings. Natural light is further featured within this kitchen through the skylight complimenting the stunning windows in the family and entrance way.<br\/><br\/>The family, kitchen and dining areas of the home all showcase polished timber flooring which adds warmth and sophistication to the open plan layout. Dining is spacious enough for an 8-seat table, while the family can relax after dinner in comfort around the tv in the family area with views to the pool.<br\/><br\/>The sunroom connects the main house with the purpose-built addition which could be utilized as a teenager's retreat, guest suite, home office, or even rented out privately. The bedroom for the retreat has its own ensuite also upgraded with shower, vanity and separate toilet, while the living space features exposed beams, fire place and split system air conditioning for the creature comforts. French doors from the sunroom provide outside access to some of this homes' best features - the outdoor entertaining areas.<br\/>Entertaining at the rear of this home, outside the kitchen, is the perfect BBQ area for smaller, more intimate social gatherings. Horizontal wood decking has been used to create this secluded and yet warm, inviting area, perfect for a quiet drink after work.<br\/><br\/>The terrace to the front of the house, off the sunroom, is perfect for large social gatherings with views across the garden, the valley and pool areas making it the perfect place for parties, birthdays or other celebrations. The salt water pool is enclosed with pool fence and decking surrounds the pool, the perfect place to lie back on a sun lounge and enjoy a drink or a good book.<br\/>Carparking is abundant with a dual carport that also includes a workshop and storage room in addition to the open-air parking for an additional 3 vehicles that could alternatively accommodate a caravan, trailer or boat.<br\/>RLA

Hill is known for big homes on large, beautifully presented allotments. This classic Georgian-inspired stunner is no exception. Located on a commanding corner position with impressive formal gardens, it offers plenty of space and is just minutes from the picturesque Flagstaff Hill Golf Course. <br\/><br\/>This custom built  two-storey design home with red brick facade, portico, grand front entry steps, lush front lawn, double garage and paved dual driveways has immediate presence. <br\/><br\/>The living areas are downstairs and comprise a huge family room and a formal lounge and dining area on either side of a large central staircase and tiled entry hall. Neutral d\u00e9cor and elegant detailing add touches of grandeur, including ceiling roses, leadlight, double timber doors, quality light fittings and custom window treatments with pelmets. The spacious timber kitchen overlooks the rear garden and features a large pantry, double sink, stainless steel appliances, wall oven and gas cook-top. <br\/><br\/>There are four bedrooms and two bathrooms on the upper level, including an en-suite bathroom and walk-in robe for the generous master bedroom. Ducted air conditioning ensures family comfort. Includes a 3.2kw Solar Panel system. <br\/><br\/>The rear yard is wonderfully private with a focus on outdoor entertaining. A huge pitched roof pergola covers a paved area that spans the full width of the home, framed by a retaining wall of moss rocks and a formal lawned garden. Clear caf\u00e9 blinds transform the pergola into an outdoor room ideal for family gatherings. <br\/><br\/>Ample parking is provided with two double driveways, a double garage with roller doors and additional secure parking for a caravan and boat. There is also a small garden shed at rear. <br\/><br\/>The suburb offers easy access to schools, transport, shops and reserves. The Hub Shopping Centre and a great local library are 5 minutes away with Marion Shopping Centre, Flinders University and public and private hospitals all within a short 15 minute drive.

Perfectly located, a thriving park is right next door and will entertain the kids for hours after school. With a number of good quality schools within driving distance you are spoilt for choice! Between Main South Road and the Expressway, a trip in either direction has never been more convenient and with public transport approximately a 600m walk away you can comfortably leave the car at home. I think you'll agree the whole family has been catered for with this beautiful family home.  <br\/><br\/>Stepping inside this home offers 4 bedrooms. The master bedroom is very generous in size with room for a relaxing parent retreat, as well as a walk-in robe and ensuite. Bedrooms 2, 3 and 4 are all different. Bedroom 2 offers a large walk-in robe, Bedroom 3 is a decent size with mirrored built in robe and Bedroom 4 is a good size with built in robe. The main bathroom is perfect for the busy household with a separate vanity, shower and toilet.   <br\/><br\/>Open plan living is at the heart of the home with a separate lounge offering a private play space for the kids away from the hustle and bustle of the kitchen. The common areas of the home have beautiful porcelain tiles whilst the sleeping quarters and separate lounge are nicely carpeted. The kitchen offers plenty of bench and cupboard space and a gas cooktop. With reverse cycle air conditioning throughout you will have year-round comfort.  <br\/><br\/>Stepping outside we have two separate areas, the main courtyard space is perfect for entertaining with the proximity to the open plan living it makes for a smooth transition from inside to outside and offers enough room for an outdoor setting. Walking around the corner is a split level grassed area for the kids to run around with plenty of room for a trampoline or swing set. Between the grassed area out the back for the kids to play and the park just next door to explore you can expect to see them home for dinner!  <br\/><br\/>For more information or to register your interest, contact Pete Fallon (RLA222182)   <br\/><br\/>All floorplans, photos and text are for illustration purposes only and are not intended to be part of any contract.

a touch of prestige,  I believe this property to be one of the nicest homes currently for sale in the district.<br\/>Constructed in 2010, this imposing 2 storey residence would delight any family looking for somewhere to call home, and to call it home for a very long time. It offers ample room to suit a growing family with changing needs, as the years go by.<br\/><br\/>Offering an impressive formal entrance with an elegant dining room to one side and a formal lounge or sitting room, just perfect for the adults and their guests, to the other. Take a couple of steps further on the large tiles and you enter the hub of the home. This is where everyday life occurs. The open plan kitchen with quality 2-pak cupboards, visually striking splash back and ample bench space will delight the chef of the household. With an adjoining meals area, perfect for everyday living, all the family will be involved in the morning rush or perhaps a calmer, evening meal.<br\/><br\/>Up a couple more steps and you're greeted with the family area that ideally, everyone will use for those evenings when all the family are together, chatting, talking or just watching T.V. It's the ideal space in which to relax and chill out.<br\/><br\/>The main bedroom suite upstairs features a private balcony with views over the gully and beyond. There's also a large walk-in robe and a spacious ensuite bathroom. <br\/><br\/>With four bedrooms and two bathrooms in total, together with an additional toilet and powder room off the laundry, there shouldn't be any delays in getting to school on time.<br\/>Full length, glass sliding doors lead from the living area of the home to a comfortable, covered breakfast or barbeque spot. With retaining wall, and lush plantings this protected area could be used most months of the year. Beyond the retaining wall are the spacious lawns and garden area of the home and being on over 700 square metres, there's plenty of room for playground equipment, trampolines and cubby houses, not to mention being ideal for the dog and the occasional cart-wheel.<br\/><br\/>Offering over 250 square metres of family living, all the elements are taken care of with ducted, reverse cycle air conditioning throughout as well as an additional split system in the family room.<br\/><br\/>The double garage, with direct access to the home, will ensure you never get wet bringing in the shopping.<br\/><br\/>Positioned on the high side of this very quiet street, the home provides a lovely vantage point for sunset views. With easy access to local private & public schools,  good shopping at the Hallett Cove shopping Centre,  public transport, southern beaches and the City make this property a must see.<br\/><br\/>The current owners are purchasing elsewhere so this is up for most genuine sale indeed.

Greenery floats above and beneath for ambience as extensive paving brings the hordes to yours, with room for a kid and pet-friendly energy release on the well-kept lawns.<br\/><br\/>Family-ready floors take the traffic indoors, and a timber kitchen (a project down the track perhaps?) serves its purpose amongst the activity centre of this family-centric home.<br\/><br\/>Bedrooms deserve space to themselves, and this home grants it; from the bay window master with an en suite spa and wall of robes, to three more bedrooms (or two with robes plus a study) align with a family bathroom and separate WC. Family harmony indeed. <br\/><br\/>Considered multi-car parking for multi-car families is a must - dual driveway space and dual roller doors make the revolving door lifestyles easier to manage.<br\/><br\/>In this tranquil setting, amenities pop up around every wooded corner; Thalassa Park playground, shopping at The Hub, Aberfoyle Hub Primary School or further afield, Flinders Uni.<br\/><br\/>The koalas and kookaburras know the territory; start your day in serenity on Bushland Drive. <br\/><br\/>We love<br\/>- Landscaped elevation in wooded surrounds<br\/>- Exclusive Woodland Ridge Estate<br\/>- City & sea views<br\/>- Paved all-weather gabled alfresco<br\/>- Up to 4 bedrooms (or 3 plus study)<br\/>- Bay window master with en suite & spa<br\/>- Ducted air conditioning<br\/>- Ducted gas heating<br\/>- Combustion fire to family room<br\/>- Close to amenities, shopping & Flinders Uni<br\/>- Dual garaging with secure auto roller doors<br\/>- The serenity of Bushland Drive...<br\/><br\/><br\/>CT \/ 5141\/849<br\/>Council \/ City of Onkaparinga<br\/>Zoning \/ RH<br\/>Built \/ 1994<br\/>Land \/ 716m2<br\/>Council Rates \/ $1920.52pa<br\/>SA Water \/ $188.91pq<br\/><br\/>The accuracy of this information cannot be guaranteed and all interested parties should seek independent advice.

BY APPOINTMENT<br\/><br\/>Located in the leafy Woodland Ridge Estate in Aberfoyle Park, this spacious 4 bedroom home was built in 1989 on a 670 SqM allotment amongst other quality homes and stands proudly on the high side of a cul-de-sac.  The area is quiet and all services are nearby including schools, shopping, transport and health services.<br\/><br\/>The home is spacious and fully featured with modern gas cooking, ducted R\/C air conditioning plus gas heating.  The bedrooms are roomy and the Master boasts ensuite and WIR.  The 2nd & 3rd bedrooms have BIRs and the 4th is being utilised as a study.  There is a formal lounge\/dine separate to the kitchen which is open plan to the family and meals area.  This section of the home seems to be all windows creating a light, bright ambiance looking out to the pristine, solar heated pool.  Sliding doors from the family room give access to an extensive undercover entertaining area and the pool.  What a history of family gatherings and good times have been experienced in this wonderful space.<br\/><br\/>This fully featured family home has NBN connected, has a double auto carport with drive through and a workshop\/shed at the rear big enough for the home handyman to ply his skills.  There is a 2nd driveway and parking for a van or boat; so plenty of opportunity here for the \"Grey Nomads\" to park their \u2018home away from home' in between trips.  There is parkland reserve close by and all the services and amenities required for comfortable living within minutes of the front door.<br\/><br\/>Priced to sell , this is one family home not to be

The rear unit is currently empty while the other, the original home, is currently tenanted for $220 per week. This means you can still generate income while waiting for plans & approvals.  <br\/>Located close by to plenty of shops, schools and of course handy to transport it ticks all the boxes.   <br\/>Don't miss out on this marvellous opportunity, call Mike or Zoe today.  <br\/><br\/>Only the rear unit is shown on the floor plan.   <br\/>All floorplans, photos and text are for illustration purposes only and are not intended to be part of any contract.
